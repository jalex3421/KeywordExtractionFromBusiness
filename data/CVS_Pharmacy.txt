Great Pharmacy. I think they're fantastic people here- better than other CVS stores I've visited and used. They do great work.
Late-night supply run.
Bottled water is always on sale. My building has really old pipes, the water smells funny, and taste like crap.
24-Hour Pharmacy
This place is hell between cashiers who could careless and the auto check out... Note to self NEVER RETURN!
Terrible
Major renovations in progress, lots of new self checkout stations.
Worst drugstore ever... You shold call it the dollar store instead since.it has so junk in.it...
Now carrying Eyes Lips Face cosmetics!
Has the essentials but often doesn't have what I'm looking for (specific brands of sonicare brushes, my favorite cereal, etc)
The Bird and The Bee playing on the PA, awesome.
Good selection for a pharmacy. Good value/savings with CVS Care Card. Also, the employees are very friendly, knowledgeable and helpful!
Pharmacy slow with big line at 7pm
Open 24/7 is a plus. But items are marked up at this location  ....
VERY lousy service!!!
