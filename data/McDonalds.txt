Was clean today and workers were pleasant to me
Home of the homeless...Slow service
This mcD is SO nice now it's crazy. There's a guy with a bullet proof vest and a gun sweeping the floor though which is strange. Feels like ikea in this beast.
Good fast food and clean
Not good
Holy shit this is the most poorly run Mc.Bud's I've been to. Couldn't wait to get my egg McMuffin and coffee-flavored coffee and skeedaddle.
Shout out to Will, he was awesome!
Took 15 minutes. Terrible wait
I feel dirty !!!!!
Worst service ever. Close this joint at the Walmart
The service is fast and efficient.
The nastiest, loudest McDonald's ever. The employees are rude. I left.
Sausage Mcmuffin hit the spot!! This is free booty injections :)
Closed for remodel
Make sure you have everything you need before you leave because they won't give it to you!
The menu board states that the combo meal comes with a medium drink but they then charge extra for the MEDIUM  DRINK!!  I work a block away & I'll never go there again!  McDonald's has reached a new low to get a few more cents out of each customer.
Messed up both me and my husbands orders. Sigh...
Omg worst service !!!!!
This place must have been used as inspiration for Dave Chappelle's skit "Wack Arnolds". It's like the attitudes are dead on.
the last people who deserve $15 an hour are these people lmao
